# Artificial Intelligence with ML

## Practical Programs

1. Create a game that picks 21 cards from a deck of 52 cards and make three stacks of 7 cards each. Guess one particular card from any stack and declare only the stack where the selected card is available. Repeat the same process two times to help you find the selected card.

```python
# Code for Practical-01
```

2. Create a game that picks four cards from a deck of 52 cards and computes their sum. An ace, king, queen, and jack represent 1, 13, 12, and 11, respectively. Your program should display the number of picks that yield the sum of 24.

```python
# Code for Practical-02
```

3. Create a game Tic-Tac-Toe using MinMax search technique. Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game to play between two people. One player is X and the other player is O. On a simple nine-square grid (which we call the board), the players take turns placing their X or O on the board. If a player gets three of their marks on the board in a row, column, or one of the two diagonals, they win.

```python
# Code for Practical-03
```

4. The classic Eight Queens game is to place eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other (i.e., no two queens are in the same row, same column, or same diagonal).

```python
# Code for Practical-04
```

5. Basic exercises on Python Machine Learning Packages such as Numpy, Scikit, and Matplotlib. Given a dataset, write a program to compute the Covariance, Correlation between a pair of attributes. Also, compute the Covariance Matrix and Correlation Matrix.

```python
# Code for Practical-05
```

6. Given a set of sample points in an N-dimensional feature space, write a program to fit the points with a hyperplane using Linear Regression. Calculate the sum of the residual error.

```python
# Code for Practical-06
```

7. Write a program that provides an option to compute different distance measures between two points in the N-dimensional feature space. Consider some sample datasets for computing distances among sample points.

```python
# Code for Practical-07
```

8. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree-based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate dataset for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.

```python
# Code for Practical-08
```

9. Write a program to implement the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris dataset. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Python ML library classes can be used for this problem.

```python
# Code for Practical-09
```

10. Write a program to implement feature reduction using Principle Component Analysis.

```python
# Code for Practical-10
```

11. Study and Implement various Ensemble methods of classifiers: Bagging, Boosting, Stacking.

```python
# Code for Practical-11
```

12. Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training dataset stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering a few test datasets.

```python
# Code for Practical-12
```

13. Given a dataset for a classification task, write a program to implement Support Vector Machine and estimate its test performance.

```python
# Code for Practical-13
```

14. Write a program to implement the K-means clustering algorithm. Select your dataset to test the program.

```python
# Code for Practical-14
```
