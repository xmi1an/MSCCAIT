## Perform SQL Injection Attacks on an MSSQL Database using sqlmap

In this practical, we will learn how to perform SQL injection attacks on an MSSQL database using sqlmap.

### Step 1: Identify the Target

1. Identify a web application that is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks on an MSSQL database. This can be done through manual analysis or using vulnerability scanning tools.
2. Confirm the existence of the vulnerability by attempting to inject SQL queries into the application.

### Step 2: Install and Configure sqlmap

1. Install sqlmap by following the official documentation.
2. Open a terminal and run the following command to check if sqlmap is installed:

   ```
   sqlmap --version
   ```

3. If sqlmap is installed, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, install sqlmap using the appropriate method for your operating system.

### Step 3: Enumerate the Database

1. Run the following command to enumerate the database:

   ```
   sqlmap -u <target_url> --dbs
   ```

   Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the vulnerable web application.

2. sqlmap will start enumerating the databases and display a list of available databases.

### Step 4: Enumerate Tables

1. Run the following command to enumerate the tables in a specific database:

   ```
   sqlmap -u <target_url> -D <database_name> --tables
   ```

   Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the vulnerable web application and `<database_name>` with the name of the database you want to enumerate tables from.

2. sqlmap will start enumerating the tables in the specified database and display a list of available tables.

### Step 5: Dump Data from a Table

1. Run the following command to dump data from a specific table:

   ```
   sqlmap -u <target_url> -D <database_name> -T <table_name> --dump
   ```

   Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the vulnerable web application, `<database_name>` with the name of the database, and `<table_name>` with the name of the table you want to dump data from.

2. sqlmap will start dumping the data from the specified table and display the retrieved data.

### Step 6: Documenting the Process

1. Open a new markdown file named `Practical-22.md`.
2. Write a detailed step-by-step explanation of the SQL injection attack process using sqlmap.
3. Use appropriate markdown tags to format the document and make it easy to read.
4. Include any screenshots or code snippets that are relevant to the process.
5. Save the file and submit it as part of your assignment.

Remember to always use these techniques responsibly and with proper authorization.

Good luck with your assignment!
