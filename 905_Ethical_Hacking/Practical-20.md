## Perform Exploitation of RCE/File Upload Vulnerability

In this practical, we will learn how to perform the exploitation of RCE (Remote Code Execution) or File Upload vulnerability.

### Step 1: Identify the Vulnerability

1. Identify a web application that is vulnerable to RCE or File Upload vulnerability. This can be done through manual analysis or using vulnerability scanning tools.
2. Confirm the existence of the vulnerability by attempting to upload a malicious file or executing arbitrary code.

### Step 2: Exploit the Vulnerability

1. Determine the type of vulnerability (RCE or File Upload) and the specific exploit technique to be used.
2. Prepare the payload or malicious file that will be used to exploit the vulnerability.
3. Upload the payload or malicious file to the target web application.
4. Trigger the vulnerability by accessing the uploaded file or executing the payload.

### Step 3: Gain Unauthorized Access

1. Once the vulnerability is successfully exploited, you may gain unauthorized access to the target system.
2. Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, you may be able to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive information, or perform other malicious activities.

### Step 4: Documenting the Process

1. Open a new markdown file named `Practical-20.md`.
2. Write a detailed step-by-step explanation of the exploitation process.
3. Use appropriate markdown tags to format the document and make it easy to read.
4. Include any screenshots or code snippets that are relevant to the process.
5. Save the file and submit it as part of your assignment.

Remember to always use these techniques responsibly and with proper authorization.

Good luck with your assignment!
