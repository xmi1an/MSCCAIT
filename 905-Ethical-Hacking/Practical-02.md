# Practical 02: Perform Foot Printing and Reconnaissance

In this practical, we will perform foot printing and reconnaissance using various tools and techniques.

## Step 1: Using Search Engines (Google Dorks)

1. Open your web browser and go to Google.
2. In the search bar, type in a Google Dork query. For example, "site:example.com filetype:pdf" to find PDF files on a specific website.
3. Analyze the search results for any useful information.

## Step 2: Using Web Services and Social Networking Sites, Email Footprinting

1. Use tools like Netcraft and theHarvester to gather information about a target from web services and social networking sites.
2. Use the TOR Browser to anonymize your activities.
3. Use sherlock to find usernames across social networks.

## Step 3: Website Footprinting

1. Use the ping command to determine the IP address of a target website.
2. Use Web Site Copier to download a website for offline analysis.
3. Use CeWL to generate a wordlist based on a website's content.

## Step 4: Whois/DNS Footprinting

1. Use the nslookup command to find DNS records for a target domain.
2. Use DNSRecon for advanced DNS enumeration.

By following these steps, we can gather a significant amount of information about our target, which can be useful in later stages of an ethical hacking operation.
