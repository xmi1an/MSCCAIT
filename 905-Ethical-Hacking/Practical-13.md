## Session Hijacking: Perform various session hijacking techniques Zed Attack Proxy, bettercap, Wireshark

### Step 1: Introduction
In this practical, we will learn how to perform various session hijacking techniques using tools like Zed Attack Proxy, bettercap, and Wireshark.

### Step 2: Understanding Session Hijacking
Session hijacking is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to a user's session on a web application or network. It involves intercepting and manipulating session data to impersonate the user and perform malicious activities.

### Step 3: Setting up the Environment
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Kali Linux machine (attacker machine)
- Target web application or network

### Step 4: Using Zed Attack Proxy
1. Open a terminal on your Kali Linux machine.
2. Launch Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) by typing `zap` in the terminal.
3. Configure ZAP to intercept HTTP traffic by going to "Tools" > "Options" > "Local Proxy" and setting the proxy address to `localhost` and port to `8080`.
4. Configure your web browser to use ZAP as a proxy. This can usually be done in the browser's network settings.
5. Access the target web application through the browser. ZAP will intercept the traffic and display it in its interface.
6. Analyze the intercepted requests and responses to identify session-related information.

### Step 5: Using bettercap
1. Open a terminal on your Kali Linux machine.
2. Install bettercap using the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install bettercap
   ```
3. Launch bettercap by typing `bettercap` in the terminal.
4. Configure bettercap to intercept HTTP traffic by running the following command:
   ```
   set http.proxy.handler hijack
   ```
5. Start the interception by running the following command:
   ```
   start
   ```
6. Configure your web browser to use bettercap as a proxy. This can usually be done in the browser's network settings.
7. Access the target web application through the browser. bettercap will intercept the traffic and display it in its interface.
8. Analyze the intercepted requests and responses to identify session-related information.

### Step 6: Using Wireshark
1. Open a terminal on your Kali Linux machine.
2. Install Wireshark using the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install wireshark
   ```
3. Launch Wireshark by typing `wireshark` in the terminal.
4. Select the network interface through which you want to capture traffic.
5. Start the capture by clicking on the "Start" button in the Wireshark interface.
6. Access the target web application through your web browser. Wireshark will capture the network traffic.
7. Analyze the captured packets to identify session-related information.

### Step 7: Performing Session Hijacking
Once you have identified session-related information using the above tools, you can perform session hijacking by manipulating the session data. This can include stealing session cookies, modifying session parameters, or injecting malicious code into the session.

Note: Session hijacking is illegal and unethical unless performed with proper authorization and for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions before attempting any session hijacking techniques.
