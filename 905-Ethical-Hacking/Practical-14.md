## Evading IDS, Firewalls, and Honeypots: Perform Intrusion Detection using Various Tools like, snort and evading firewalls NMAP Evasion Techniques and bypass firewall rules using HTTP/FTP Tunneling

### Step 1: Introduction
In this practical, we will learn how to perform intrusion detection using tools like Snort and how to evade IDS, firewalls, and honeypots. We will also explore NMAP evasion techniques and bypass firewall rules using HTTP/FTP tunneling.

### Step 2: Understanding Intrusion Detection
Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring network traffic and system activities to identify and respond to potential security threats. It helps in detecting unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, and other malicious activities.

### Step 3: Setting up the Environment
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Kali Linux machine (attacker machine)
- Target network (can be a virtual network or a physical network)

### Step 4: Installing Snort
1. Open a terminal on your Kali Linux machine.
2. Install Snort using the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install snort
   ```
3. Configure Snort by editing the configuration file located at `/etc/snort/snort.conf`.

### Step 5: Performing Intrusion Detection with Snort
1. Launch Snort by typing `snort -i <interface>` in the terminal.
   Replace `<interface>` with the network interface you want to monitor.
2. Snort will start monitoring network traffic and generate alerts for suspicious activities based on its ruleset.

### Step 6: Evading IDS and Firewalls
1. Use NMAP evasion techniques to bypass IDS and firewalls.
   ```
   nmap -sS -T1 -p 80 <target_ip>
   ```
   Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the target system.
2. Explore other NMAP evasion techniques and experiment with different options to bypass IDS and firewalls.

### Step 7: Bypassing Firewall Rules using HTTP/FTP Tunneling
1. Use tools like HTTPTunnel or FTP bounce attack to bypass firewall rules.
2. Configure the tool to establish a tunnel through the firewall using HTTP or FTP protocols.
3. Use the tunnel to bypass firewall restrictions and access restricted resources.

### Step 8: Detecting and Responding to Intrusions
1. Monitor Snort alerts and analyze the captured network traffic for any suspicious activities.
2. Investigate the source and nature of the intrusion.
3. Take appropriate actions to mitigate the intrusion, such as blocking the attacker's IP address or updating firewall rules.

### Step 9: Conclusion
In this practical, we learned how to perform intrusion detection using tools like Snort and how to evade IDS, firewalls, and honeypots. We also explored NMAP evasion techniques and bypassed firewall rules using HTTP/FTP tunneling.
