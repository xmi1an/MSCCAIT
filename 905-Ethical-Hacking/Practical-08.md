## Perform Privilege Escalation, Hack the Windows Machine using Metasploit and perform Post-Exploitation using Meterpreter

### Step 1: Introduction
In this practical, we will learn how to perform privilege escalation, hack a Windows machine using Metasploit, and perform post-exploitation using Meterpreter.

### Step 2: Setting up the Environment
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Kali Linux machine (attacker machine)
- Windows machine (victim machine)
- Metasploit Framework installed on the Kali Linux machine

### Step 3: Scanning the Target
1. Open a terminal on your Kali Linux machine.
2. Use the `nmap` command to scan the target Windows machine and identify open ports and services.
   ```
   nmap -p- <target_ip>
   ```
   Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the Windows machine.

### Step 4: Exploiting Vulnerabilities
1. Launch the Metasploit Framework by typing `msfconsole` in the terminal.
2. Search for exploits related to Windows privilege escalation using the `search` command.
   ```
   search windows privilege escalation
   ```
3. Select an appropriate exploit from the search results.
4. Set the required options for the selected exploit using the `set` command.
5. Run the exploit using the `exploit` command.

### Step 5: Post-Exploitation with Meterpreter
1. Once the exploit is successful, you will have a Meterpreter session.
2. Use the `sessions` command to list all active sessions.
3. Select the session corresponding to the exploited Windows machine using the `sessions -i <session_id>` command.
   Replace `<session_id>` with the session ID of the exploited machine.
4. Now, you have a Meterpreter shell on the Windows machine. You can perform various post-exploitation activities such as:
   - Gathering system information
   - Accessing files and directories
   - Capturing screenshots
   - Keylogging
   - etc.

### Step 6: Cleanup
After completing the post-exploitation activities, it is important to clean up the traces of the attack. Use the following commands:
- `sessions -K` to kill the Meterpreter session.
- `exit` to exit the Metasploit Framework.

### Conclusion
In this practical, we learned how to perform privilege escalation, hack a Windows machine using Metasploit, and perform post-exploitation using Meterpreter. It is important to use these techniques responsibly and only for ethical purposes.
