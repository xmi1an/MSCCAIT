## Perform Footprint, attacks on Wireless Network

In this practical, we will learn how to perform footprinting and attacks on a wireless network.

### Step 1: Footprinting

1. Identify the target wireless network that you want to perform footprinting on.
2. Use tools like Kismet, Airodump-ng, or Wireshark to capture wireless network traffic.
3. Analyze the captured traffic to gather information about the network, such as SSID, MAC addresses, encryption type, and connected devices.

### Step 2: Wireless Network Attacks

1. Once you have gathered information about the target wireless network, you can proceed with performing attacks.
2. Use tools like Aircrack-ng, Reaver, or Wifite to perform attacks such as WEP/WPA/WPA2 cracking, deauthentication attacks, or rogue access point creation.
3. Follow the documentation of the selected tool to configure and execute the desired attack.

### Step 3: Documenting the Process

1. Open a new markdown file named `Practical-24.md`.
2. Write a detailed step-by-step explanation of the footprinting and wireless network attacks process.
3. Use appropriate markdown tags to format the document and make it easy to read.
4. Include any screenshots or code snippets that are relevant to the process.
5. Save the file and submit it as part of your assignment.

Remember to always use these techniques responsibly and with proper authorization.

Good luck with your assignment!
